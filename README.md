# Recognizing Dendrite Radius

This is a machine-learning based tool to recognize dendrite radius.

## TODO:
* Implement proper data feeding mechanism.
* Extract more images
* Normalize the input images
* Normalize the labels
* Image augmentation - rotation
* Test the effect of labels: regression vs. classification
* Test the effect of RNN vs CNN
* Test the effect of combined RNN+CNN

## Models
* Basic MLP
* Basic CNN
* RNN
